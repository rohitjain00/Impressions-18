# Impressions-18
In the college fest of 2018 we had an amazong oppertunity to organise two of our events. We decided on the following two games to be organised. As the fest was cultural and not technical we were bound to the technical aspects of the games/events that was to organise.

Our task included to complete marketing, registration and to think about all the possible ways to organise with the resources that were available.

We created eye catching posters of the game. Created a website to get all the details for the games out and linked it to the poster. We created task for estimated number of teams we had in the registration form up until the last day.

First day was the "The Imitation Game" no one showed up. We had a total registration of 5 teams for the event. We waited for a hour before leaving the venue. It was total disaster. We tried calling the students to their cell phone about the registration they made and they were attending other events in the college.

Second day was a success the "Beg Borrow Steal" game was a classic. Even though we only had 7 registration we managed to get around 15 teams to take part in this. As for the prize we had only single price for the winner. First team came in under 20-30 minutes completing the task and won. We waited a little longer to inform other teams that the winner is decided.


At the end of this event I learned how to organise an event on my own and how different things effect the event's participation. This was the first time I was sitting on the other side of the table i.e. organising an event rather than attending it.
